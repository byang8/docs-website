The MySQL integration is open source software. That means you can [browse its source code](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-mysql) and [send improvements](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-mysql/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), or create your own fork and build it.

### MySQL Instance Settings [#instance-settings]

The MySQL integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. In the table, use the **Applies to** column for the settings available to each collection:

The values for these settings can be defined in several ways:
* Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way.
* Replace the values from environment variables using the `{{}}` notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on [infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/configuration/configure-infrastructure-agent/#passthrough).
* Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see [secrets management](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/secrets-management).

## Metrics [#metrics]

The MySQL integration collects the following metrics:
- [Default metrics](#default-metrics)
- [Extended metrics](#extended-metrics)
- [Extended innodb metrics](#extended-innodb-metrics)
- [Extended myisam metrics](#extended_myisam-metrics)
- [Extended slave cluster metrics](#slave-cluster-metrics)

### Default metrics [#default-metrics]

These metrics are captured by default:

## Inventory [#inventory]

The MySQL integration captures the configuration parameters of the MySQL node returned by `SHOW GLOBAL VARIABLES`. The data is available on the [Inventory page](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/infrastructure-ui-pages/infrastructure-inventory-page-search-your-entire-infrastructure), under the `config/mysql` source.

## System metadata [#metadata]

The MySQL integration collects the following metadata [attributes](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#attribute) about your MySQL system:
